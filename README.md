# Yamaha-CL-Automated-Backup
This is an applescript used to automate backing up of a CL Series console via an ethernet connection.

## How to Run
Just run the application and the app will prompt you to setup a few things first. What's pretty cool is it can be [triggered](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/10/19/mac-calendar-open-file-alerts/) from the calendar to run at a specific time. Pretty convenient.
If you ever need to reset the settings, just delete the settings file that is saved in your documents. No need to get permissions or admin credentials again. The next time the app is run it will ask you to set things up again.

## Requirements
* CL Editor needs to be installed. https://usa.yamaha.com/support/updates/cl_edt_mac.html
* A Yamaha CL console needs to be on the same network as the computer running the backup tool.
